# DriversUtils

DriversUtils is a plugin/modification for the game SCP:Secret Labratory. It is specifically developed for my personal server, so therefore this is more just for version control.


# Dependinces 
- MapEditorReborn
- HintServiceMeow
- Exiled (Non-reboot)

# Features

### Custom Items
- SCP 1499.
- Multiple Versions of SCP-500
- Alternative Grenades
- + More soon.

### SCP-294
Not ported yet.
- Has lots of drinks from SCP: Containment Breach. Not balanced at all but that's what makes it fun.
- The machine model is not in this plugin, we are using slocLoader to create the physical machine in both EZ and LCZ.

### Serpents Hand
Not ported yet.
- Has two classes, The captain and the agent. Captains are beefier and agents are the standard class.


### Subclasses
- wip, working on porting again

### Other Changes
- Coins get "randomized" (changed into a random item from a list) on very fine.
- SCP-049-2 instances have their height randomized
+ More soon once I finish porting and once 14.0 is updated!

Have fun!
