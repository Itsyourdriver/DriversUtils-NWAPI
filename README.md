# DriversUtils


# Updated.. For now. (thanks visual studio for being terrible when committing)
## Builds will NOT be provided unless I make a seperate version that is a little bit better and isn't janky.
A SCPSL NorthwoodAPI (NWAPI) plugin purpose built for a private server; currently has these features:

# Requires https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/ 's Utility.dll and Teleport.dll (teleport is not used for now)


there's a bunch of other tweaks that I forgor about that I won't be listing sorry

### SCP-294 Command

Just a bunch of drinks, used in conjunction with slocLoader to add a machine to one of the rooms in EZ.

### Serpents Hand (Credit to TheRiptide) for some of the code behind this (spawning logic)

Serpents Hand! But it's janky! Mostly finished and functions as it should now.

### Custom CASSIE Messages
More coming soon, however this adds a custom chance message which is a nice immersion message letting everyone know that SCP-999 was lost in decontamination :(( (as we also use slocLoader to make our own little guy in the candy room :D)


### Custom Roles
Facility Guard Captain class which is like a beefed up guard, which everyone on our server likes (amazingly), due to the fact that it makes early game have more affects on the end of the game, because you can do MUCH, MUCH more damage. as we play with a small amount of people.


+ more if I ever add any, feel free to modify this or help me to patch out bugs

Have fun!
