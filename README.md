# DriversUtils

### V2.0 will come when LabAPI is released.
v1.99

## Builds will NOT be provided unless you want to fill in the things that are missing for you from this plugin, you will also have to live with some hardcoded features that aren't toggleable.

A SCPSL NorthwoodAPI (NWAPI) plugin purpose built for a private server; currently has these features:

# Requires https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/ 's Utility.dll & maybe some other things that I might've forgot about.


there's a bunch of other tweaks that I forgor about that I won't be listing because I haven't worked on this since january

### SCP-294 Command

Just a bunch of drinks, used in conjunction with slocLoader to add a machine to one of the rooms in EZ & LCZ.
Has a lot of things from SCP:CB and a hell of a lot of custom things.

### Serpents Hand (Credit to TheRiptide for some of the code behind this)

Serpents Hand! They collaborate with scps and assist them throughout the round.

### Custom CASSIE Messages
More coming soon, however this adds a custom chance message which is a nice immersion message letting everyone know that SCP-999 was lost in decontamination :(( (as we also use slocLoader to make our own little guy in the candy room :D)

### PcBuff
Adds 2 commands to assist SCP-079 very slightly, .blackout isn't very useful (as you need a higher tier, it has a high cooldown, and uses a lot of power), finally .findally or .findallies (or the other aliases i forgot about) allows you to see the current room of serpents hand for better cooperation because they usually don't have a way to communicate unless they find eachother.

### Subclasses
MTF Nu-7 can spawn. They have 10 more hp, guaranteed better gear, and are basically just epsilon-11 on steroids. :D
Facility Guard Captain class which is like a beefed up guard, which everyone on our server likes (amazingly), due to the fact that it makes early game have more affects on the end of the game, because you can do MUCH, MUCH more damage. as we play with a small amount of people.
Adds "The Kid", whom spawns with candy and is shorter than everyone else. This was fun during the christmas event so we could have voice effects using the cake :)
Adds the MTF Boom Boom Boy (would've been called Demolitionist but friends voted otherwise). Self explanatory.


### Balance Tweaks
Chaos will be forced if mtf spawn twice in a row. Mostly fixes some of the issues for **low** player servers.
Some misc changed related to scps and stuff like that, not many though.

+ more tweaks that I probably forgot about

Have fun!
